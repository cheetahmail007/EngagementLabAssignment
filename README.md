# EngagementLabAssignment
This is a sample android application to get movies listüçøusing [Disney API]( https://disneyapi.dev/) - which is built to demonstrate use of *Modern Android development* tools. It has been built using kotlin with clean architecture principles and MVVM pattern as well as Architecture Components. 
Dedicated to all Android Developers with ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## About
The app in itself is a simple movie searrch on the basis Id. Clicking the movie list item it shows the detail of the movie. While this is not an extremely complex app, it isn't a silly Hello World one either, so the hope is that it'll cover regular use cases for a basic application.

## Sailent Features:
- List of movies.
- Search the movies on basis of Id.
- View the list of movies based on the search result.
- On click of movie, detail of movie
- Unit tesing for view models
- UI testing for UI
